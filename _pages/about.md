I am a researcher at Missouri University of Science & Technology. My research interests lies at the intersection of robotics, control theory, deep reinforcement learning, and multi-agent systems. 
Additionally, I have experience in formation control, model predictive control, game theory, and data-driven control. The applications I have worked on are quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles, mobile robots, robot manipulation, power systems like drum-type boiler turbine plant.

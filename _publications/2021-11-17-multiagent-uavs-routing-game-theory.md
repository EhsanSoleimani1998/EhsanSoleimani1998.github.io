### Abstract

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has rapidly advanced, enabling multi-UAV teams to perform complex missions. We investigate leader-follower formation control under both distributed and decentralized models, using a game-theoretic framework based on Nash equilibrium to highlight the differences. Our analysis shows that distributed models outperform decentralized ones in surveillance and reconnaissance speed, leading to higher mission success rates and lower operating costs under the tested conditions. These findings guide practitioners in choosing appropriate coordination architectures for cooperative UAV deployments.

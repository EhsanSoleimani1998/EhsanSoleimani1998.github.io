### Abstract

In recent research, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone technology has developed well; on the other hand, multiple UAVs have been used to perform complex missions. In this paper, the distribution model in formation control problem for multiagent robotic systems with leader-follower is investigated. To compare distributed and decentralized models, the game theory approach is used, given that it is an optimal approach based on the Nash equilibrium point, which causes the differences between the two models better showed off. In this article for leader-follower UAVs generally found that distributed models do the surveillance and reconnaissance faster. Due to the importance of a high mission success rate and operating costs, using the distributed model has been concluded. These results are based on specific conditions that can be extended; however, the results can be cited for the researcher.

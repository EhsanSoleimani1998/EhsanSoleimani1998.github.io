## Abstract

We propose a data-driven control scheme that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with iterative learning control (ILC). To overcome the shortcomings of conventional ILC under non-repetitive noise, disturbances, and model uncertainties, we introduce a dynamic Forgetting Factor ILC (FFILC). By leveraging past iteration data and optimizing the forgetting factor via RL, FFILC achieves faster convergence and greater adaptability. We provide a rigorous convergence proof and demonstrate, through simulations on a quadrotor and a drum-type boiler turbine plant, that RL-FFILC outperforms advanced baseline controllers in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness.

## Note to Practitioners

Industrial automation often relies on repetitive tasks where ILC can enhance performance—but classical ILC falters in the presence of non-repetitive disturbances or poorly known dynamics. RL-FFILC offers a practical, data-driven solution that requires no precise model identification. By adaptively learning the optimal forgetting factor online, this method improves accuracy and resilience in Cyber-Physical Systems, such as UAV flight control and power-plant turbine regulation, making it well suited for real-world industrial deployment.

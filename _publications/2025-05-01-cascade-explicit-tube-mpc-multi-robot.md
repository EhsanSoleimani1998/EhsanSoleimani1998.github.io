### Abstract
In recent years, cooperative multi-robot systems have demanded more efficient and robust control strategies. We introduce the Cascade Explicit Tube Model Predictive Controller (CET-MPC), which combines an explicit MPC with a tube MPC to reduce online computation while maintaining robustness against wind disturbances, sensor noise, and inertia uncertainties. A cascade control layer further minimizes steady-state errors and enhances dynamic performance. Simulation studies on distributed aerial robotic scenarios demonstrate that CET-MPC achieves superior tracking accuracy and resilience under realistic operating conditions compared to baseline methods.
